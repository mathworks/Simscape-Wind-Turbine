# **Wind Turbine Design with Simscape**
This example models a wind turbine with pitch actuators, yaw actuators, geartrain, 
and generator. The fidelity level of each system can be adjusted so that it is 
suitable for the test being performed.

* **Size actuators** using ideal actuator models to determine required forces.
* **Perform virtual tests of physical system and controller** with hydraulic pitch and electrical yaw actuators.
* **Optimize controller performance** with hydraulic pitch and electrical yaw actuators.
* **Assess grid integration** with model of generator and electric grid.
* **Run HIL tests** with real-time capable model of wind turbine.

Open project "Wind_Turbine.prj" to get started.
