% This example models a wind turbine with pitch actuators, yaw actuators,
% geartrain, and generator.  The fidelity level of each system can be adjusted 
% so that it is suitable for the test being performed.  
% 
% * *Size actuators* using ideal actuator models to determine required forces.
% * *Perform virtual tests of physical system and controller* with hydraulic pitch and electrical yaw actuators.
% * *Optimize controller performance* with hydraulic pitch and electrical yaw actuators.
% * *Assess grid integration* with model of generator and electric grid.
% * *Run HIL tests* with real-time capable model of wind turbine.
